Microservice Blog 1/20:

	This article gave me a better understanding of what microservices truly are. As defined by the authors, a microservice is a physically independent and tightly scoped application component in order to support extreme agility and scalability requirements. Companies such as Netflix, Amazon, and Twitter have rapidly adopted Microservice Architectures to support their massively increasing traffic volumes. Their primary goal is to provide continuous delivery by fine-graining and creating independently deployable services.
	An example of a microservice from the article that I found interesting was an e-commerce application. A microservice implementation would refactor the checkout process into multiple independent units all having separate features of the entire checkout functionality. This article also excellently outlined the clear benefits of MSA such as risk reduction since MSA deployments are small and independent. MSA also allows teams to scale parts of an application that cause contention and bottlenecks allowing developers to easily pinpoint their focus on a faltering functionality.
