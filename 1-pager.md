Uber Engineering: The Opportunities Microservices Provide
	My case study company, Uber, specializes in providing ride-sharing and food delivery. I chose Uber because I have worked for their UberEATS division for almost two years and have become very familiar with their Uber Driver app. Because of my prior experience, researching this case study will give me insight into their microservice architecture-based system and see how I, as a driver, connect with clients. Uber started in a monolithic architecture offered only in San Francisco. Having only one codebase seemed efficient at the time as it connected drivers with riders, billing, and payments. But as Uber rapidly expanded into new markets and features, there was a need to break up the monolith into multiple codebases to form a service-oriented architecture. Migrating from a monolithic codebase to a microservice architecture solved many problems but sprouted new ones as well. First, with 500+ services finding the appropriate one for a particular problem can be difficult. And once the appropriate service is found, how to utilize said service is not obvious since each microservice is structured in its own way. Second, to solve the issue of safety Uber has adopted Thrift which is a set of libraries and tools for building cross scalable applications. Thrift guarantees safety by binding services to use strict contracts which describe how to interact with that service. Lastly, to tackle the problem of resiliency, Uber employed the use of fault tolerance and latency libraries to ensure clients are able to deal with failure scenarios successfully. To prevent duplicate work across teams, Uber solves this problem by requiring that authors of new services submit a Request for Comments (RFC). The RFC consists of a high-level proposal of a new service that outlines its purpose, architecture, dependencies, and other details for Uber Engineering to discuss. The RFC allows for feedback from other Uber developers on how to improve the serviceâ€™s quality and also prevents duplicate efforts.
